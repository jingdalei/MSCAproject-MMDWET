# MSCAproject-MMDWET
# A moving contact line (MCL) is a moving line of intersection between a fluid/fluid interface and a solid wall. MCLs are central to a wide range of flows in nature and industry, ranging from surface coating, spray cooling, displacement of oil by CO2, to the recent development of 3D printing, microreactors, and nanotechnology. However, the modelling of MCLs has been a classical challenge. In particular, when the solid phase can dissolve into the wetting fluids, e.g., in soldering, formation of alloys and manufacturing of composite materials, there are still a few fundamental challenges which have handicapped the development of predictive computational models. This project will address those challenges and it has three objectives: 
# (1) to develop a new computational model for 3D direct numerical simulation (DNS) of MCLs on dissolvable solid surfaces, covering both inertial- and diffusion-dominant dissolutive wetting regimes, and resolving nanometer length scales;
# (2) to develop a novel experimental method using high-speed imaging to directly measure the interface profiles during the dynamic dissolutive wetting line, and then formulate a rigorous theory to relate the dynamic contact angle and interface profiles to system parameters.
# (3) to formulate a reduced-order macroscale computational model which can save computational effort by at least nine orders of magnitude compared with DNS models in numerical simulation of dissolutive wetting.
